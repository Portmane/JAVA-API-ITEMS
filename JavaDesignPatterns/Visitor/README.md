# Realization of Visitor Java pattern  

## Ways of realization  
I have presented two ways of realization of the Visitor Java pattern as:  
* Standard(shown on the picture). Represented in **iluwatar** package.  
* With use of two interfaces:
    * **<<-Java Class->> Unit** is replaced by **<<-Java Interface->> Shape**  
    Represented in **realizationWithTwiInterfaces** package.  
    
## Materials  
Example with two interfaces was taken from 
[this site](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor). And another used information you   
can find 
[here](https://github.com/Portmane/java-design-patterns/tree/master/visitor).  

## Cooperation  
All offers are welcome, here is my email **"wh9noo@gmail.com"**. Any corrections or help in Java code as well  
as explanations are appreciated :hugs:
