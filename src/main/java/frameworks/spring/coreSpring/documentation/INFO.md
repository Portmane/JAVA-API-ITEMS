#Documentation
   Note: 
* In big part, this representation of [documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans) is done only for  
training, better understanding and using Core Spring by the author(Portmane).  

* Package is done only for representation the mane parts of this documentation for  
more fast understood of using Core Spring features.

* This representation does't trying to say that it is better than original etc.  
It is done only for introductory frame to make use of this documentation much  
smaller and cover its core purpose for development. And I am still highly recommend  
read it in full range.
