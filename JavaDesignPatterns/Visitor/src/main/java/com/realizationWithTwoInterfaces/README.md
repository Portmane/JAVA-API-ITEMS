# Realization of Visitor Java pattern  

## Realization which uses two interfaces  
### About  
This is one of realizations of Java Visitor pattern, where I have used **two interfaces**:  
* Interface for shapes (dot, circle, etc)  
* Interface for visitors (XMLExportVisitor)  

This realization have the same structure as shown on this picture and difference only in part  
where **<<-Java Class->> Unit** is replaced by **<<-Java Interface->> Shape**.

[this site](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/visitor). And another used information you can find 
[here](https://github.com/Portmane/java-design-patterns/tree/master/visitor).
